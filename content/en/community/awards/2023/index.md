#### Autoscaling

*Kensei Nakada, [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)*  
"Kensei picked up a feature which had languished in alpha for an extended period (container resource metrics autoscaling), and drove the work required to graduate it to beta. This included significant improvements in the observability of the HPA controller metrics for all users, not just for adopters of the new functionality.
Their hard work was entirely responsible for this feature making it to beta, and being in a position to be graduated to stable in the near future, despite not having worked with SIG Autoscaling before.
Kensei's work here was a glowing example of seeing a problem and proactively solving it for all users of k8s."

#### CLI

#### Release

*Marko Mudrinić, [@xmudrii](https://github.com/xmudrii)*  
We would like to recognize Marko for his work migrating the Kubernetes release process to the use of the Open Build Service for producing deb and rpm packages. The release process had a long-standing dependency on Google for final publishing and signing of deb and rpm packages, which over time became a risk to the continued release cadence of the project. Marko led a proof of concept of this new capability, worked to integrate it seemlessly into our release process, and coordinated communications for an accelerated cutover away from the Google produced packages. We now produce and distribute packages using only community managed infrastructure and are closer to relying only on community managed infrastructure within the project.

*Kat Cosgrove, [@katcosgrove](https://github.com/katcosgrove)*  
"We would like to recognize Kat Cosgrove, for her work on the Release Team since Kubernetes v1.23, and for her collaboration across multiple SIGs within the Kubernetes community.
In particular, we'd like to highlight Kat's outstanding work during the v1.28 release cycle.
The Release Team is responsible for synthesizing inputs across multiple community groups to ensure that we can ship a high-quality and on-time release to our users. Kat noticed a gap in our reporting, escalated the issue, and then stepped up to help manage that section's responsibilities in close partnership with our friends in SIG Docs to ensure we could release.
Her consistency and follow-through in being an active participant in the release retrospectives, filing her findings, and improving process documentation for the Release Team should help to ensure that we can better manage release status reporting for all of our releases to come!"

#### Security

*Rey Lejano, [@reylejano](https://github.com/reylejano)*  
For the third-party audit, especially the post-audit follow-up, and so many other things across SIGs

*Ashish Malik, [@ashish493](https://github.com/ashish493)*  
For detailed and and collaborative work on the SIG Security Docs hardening guide

*Kris Nóva, [@krisnova](https://github.com/krisnova)*  
For so much Kubernetes security work, especially work that was done anonymously or was uncredited. We see you, we love you, and we miss you

#### Scheduling

*Shiming Zhang, [@wzshiming](https://github.com/wzshiming)*  
Shiming is co-founder of the Kubernetes sub-project KWOK, which has garnered immense popularity as a toolkit for rapidly simulating Kubernetes clusters with thousands of nodes in just seconds. His dedication to this project has played a pivotal role in elevating its status within the community. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to him for his tremendous contributions to our community.

*Yuki Iwai, [@tenzen-y](https://github.com/tenzen-y)*  
For becoming a maintainer of the Kueue subproject, after multiple contributions in code, designs and reviews.

#### Windows

*Daman Arora, [@aroradaman](https://github.com/aroradaman)*  
Daman has done a tremendous amount of work fixing low level windows-service-proxy bugs and testing it on different provider infrastructures, to help prove out, as a POC an out-of-tree implementation of the Windows Kernelspace proxy.  This has the potential to make windows networking easier to reason about and maintain.

*Tatenda Zifundi, [@tzifudzi](https://github.com/tzifudzi)*  
Tatenda has lead the operational-readiness improvements and standardization for sig-windows over the last quarter.  He has worked on behalf of his company to build a brighter and more transparent future for Kubernetes on Windows, defining what it means to be a Windows cluster for sig-windows, and the broader community at large.  This will give us a more uniform and consistent set of user expectations for K8s users on different OS's in the future.

*Kulwant Singh, [@KlwntSingh](https://github.com/KlwntSingh)*  
Kulwant has led the storage and webhook  aspects of making windows e2e tests perform consistently  across multiple clouds as part of his commitment to working with the windows operational-readiness team towards the standardization of the definition of Kubernetes on Windows, without his efforts, our broader windows standardization goals would be hard, if not impossible, to achieve.
